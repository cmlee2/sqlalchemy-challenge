# sqlalchemy-challenge

In this challenge, I was tasked with doing a climate analysis of Hawaii using Python, SQLAlchemy ORM Queries, Pandas and Matplotlib. Using the provided files, I explored and analyzed climate data, using SQLAlchemy to connect to SQLite database and query different topics. I analyzed precipitation data, station-independent data, and developed a climate app using Flask.
